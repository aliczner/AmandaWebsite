            Urbanization has led to significant habitat loss, posing challenges
            for native bee populations. In response, initiatives like "Border
            Free Bees" in Kelowna, British Columbia, have encouraged landowners
            to create pollinator-friendly gardens, providing forage and nesting
            resources to support urban bee diversity. But how effective are
            these gardens in sustaining native bee populations, and how does
            urbanization influence their impact?

            Surprisingly, we didn’t find a clear link between the number or
            variety of bees and things like garden size, plant diversity, or how
            urbanized the surrounding area was. This suggests that while
            pollinator gardens are important, other factors—like access to
            nesting areas or nearby wild habitats—may play a bigger role in
            supporting bee populations.

            This is the first study to look at urban bee diversity in the
            Okanagan, a region known for its rich pollinator communities. While
            planting pollinator-friendly gardens is a great step, our findings
            highlight the need to think beyond individual gardens and consider
            how we can create connected, bee-friendly landscapes. Supporting
            bees in cities takes a big-picture approach, and every garden is a
            valuable piece of the puzzle.
