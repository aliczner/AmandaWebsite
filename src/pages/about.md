I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the Univeristy of Guelph supervised by Dr. Nigel Raine (websitelink). We are testing for possible impacts of pesticides on the movement of bumble bees. We are doing this with the help of tiny radio tags that track their movement! See my TikToks (link) and these media stories (link) and (link) for some cool photos and videos and check out my current work page <---- this should be left side with a border with a portrait of me on the right with a border

My research interests broadly are related to behavioural ecology, conservation and restoration - especially for bumble bees! I have studied bumble bees using a variety of methods from field work to statistical modelling and of course radio tagging (current work link). You can learn more about the skills I have picked up along the way on my skills page. <---- interests I want bulletted as well as skills.

Why so much focus on bumble bees? They are (in my opinion) the very best bees! They can be found across many continents, are great pollinators for wild and crop plants, and have a very interesting life history. <---- right justified with bumble bee pic on the left

Although my specialty is bumble bee I am open to working on any ecological research project, especially those with an applied angle (see some of my past research examples on my experience page). If you are looking to collaborate take a look at my contact page!<--- centered for impact

When I am not out searching for bumble bees or analyzing data, you can find me hanging out with my dog, gardening, hiking, playing violin, baking or crafting! <-- just like the first paragraph except with a pic of me and Phoebe
