            Bumble bee queens hibernate throughout the winter by burying
            themselves in the ground. In the spring they emerge from their
            hibernation and begin looking for nest sites. Researchers have
            noticed that some species tend to wake up from hibernation earlier
            than others. The timing of when different species wake up from
            hibernation could be related to soil temperature; perhaps early
            emerging species hibernate in the top layers of soil which could
            warm up faster than deeper layers waking them up faster.

            To test the impact of soil temperature on queen bumble bee emergence
            timing, we surveyed for bumble bee queens, while simultaneously
            measuring soil temperature at different depths.
            <br />
            <br />
            In our preliminary analyses we found that some species, particularly
            early emerging species may respond to soil temperature, while later emerging
            species may respond more to air temperature.
